# Remove-Image-Background-
this application will remove any image background. For ex: if you have a group photo and only want you guys in the mix. make sure that the background is good enough so that the script can figure out what yo block out. 

Just make sure the picture is clear and no other images are stacked on it since it will break...

# Future Implementations
Will was thinking to add a GUI in VS Code and make it as an actuall applicaiton so that the script can do its magic ( will add soon! )
